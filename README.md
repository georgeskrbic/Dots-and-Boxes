# Dots-and-Boxes
Classic game Dots and Boxes recreated in Dart using StageXL. 

Players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent
dots by a line. A player that completes the fourth side of a square (a box)
colors that box and must play again. When all boxes have been colored,
the game ends and the player who has colored more boxes wins. Once this occurs
a player may elect for a rematch.
